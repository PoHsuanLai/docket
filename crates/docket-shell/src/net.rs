//! The network a sandboxed agent process gets (acp-sessions.md R2). Three modes, and the mode is
//! a choice the person made per program in the config file, never a fallback.
//!
//! - `None`: a new network namespace with only a loopback. Nothing outside is reachable.
//! - `EndpointOnly`: the same namespace, plus a forwarder inside it on `127.0.0.1:<port>` that
//!   hands every connection to one unix socket bind-mounted from outside; outside, docket bridges
//!   that socket to one loopback address (inferd's per-session model endpoint, P4). The agent
//!   sees an http base URL on its own loopback and nothing else.
//! - `Host`: the host's network, unfiltered. Weaker: the agent can reach any address and can send
//!   whatever it holds (its own login, a key) anywhere. FINDINGS "acp-client" records it.
